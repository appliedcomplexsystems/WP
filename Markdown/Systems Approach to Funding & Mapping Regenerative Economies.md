# Overview
This record combines two foundational systemic finance projects:

1. **Systems Approach to Funding** – a collaborative initiative designed to integrate systems mapping, a Learning Lab, and a Living Lab. It aims to shift funding practices from isolated impacts to interconnected, ecosystem-oriented strategies, educating funders and demonstrating systemic approaches in real-world community contexts:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

2. **Mapping Regenerative Economies & Systemic Finance (Victoria Forum 2025 catalyst)** – a participatory mapping and sensemaking initiative designed to visualize Canada’s systemic finance ecosystem. It will harvest Forum insights, illuminate leverage points, and establish a living, continuously updated knowledge base:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

# Objectives
- **Map the landscape** of systemic finance mechanisms, projects, and research bodies.  
- **Educate and empower funders** through a Learning Lab focused on systemic thinking and portfolio approaches.  
- **Pilot systemic projects** in Living Labs, demonstrating principles of regenerative and community-driven finance in action.  
- **Listen to the system** by engaging diverse actors in participatory mapping, ensuring convergence and inclusion of equity-deserving voices.  
- **Identify leverage points and gaps** in Canada’s systemic and regenerative finance flows.

# Approach
- **Constellation Model** governance: small, self-organizing action teams around mechanisms, projects, or research; stewardship group ensures coherence; neutral backbone supports continuity:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- **Mapping practice**: real-time participatory sessions (e.g., youth-led Map the System, systemic finance roundtables, embodied 3D modeling workshops):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- **Relational networking**: emphasis on trust, convergence, and inclusive community-building so that mapping is a living, social infrastructure.  
- **Interoperability**: datasets structured in open formats (CSV, GraphML), enabling integration across tools and with global initiatives (UNEP FI, TransCap, FEST).

# Anticipated Outcomes
- Richer, continuously updated systemic finance maps with identified leverage points and barriers.  
- Case studies and pilots demonstrating systemic funding models in practice.  
- Broader systemic change: funders, policymakers, and community actors adopting ecosystem-based funding and investment strategies.  
- Inclusive, equity-focused communities of practice sustained beyond single events.

# Systemic Insights
- **Leverage Points**: policy alignment, new funding instruments (e.g. blended finance, guarantees), relational trust as a form of capital.  
- **Barriers**: siloed funding streams, short grant cycles, inequitable access for Indigenous and youth-led initiatives.  
- **Loops**: reinforcing cycles where trust builds investment which builds further trust; balancing loops where risk-aversion constrains systemic projects.  
- **Level of Change**: transformational—shifting funder mental models and institutional logics from project ROI toward systemic portfolio impact.
