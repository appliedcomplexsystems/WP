# Overview
The **Global AI for Climate Alliance** brings together leading climate scientists, AI researchers, funders, and community actors to bridge gaps between domains. The Alliance was seeded through work with CIFAR, Vector Institute, Mila, and the Climate Change AI community, recognizing that current research and funding often occur in silos.  

# Objectives
- Strengthen collaboration between climate science and machine learning research.  
- Develop systemic finance mechanisms that can fund joint climate–AI initiatives.  
- Create participatory mapping backbones to identify gaps, leverage points, and opportunities for regenerative, community-led climate solutions.  
- Support youth and equity-deserving groups in shaping climate + AI innovation agendas.  

# Approach
- **Systems Mapping**: participatory processes to visualize the ecosystem of climate + AI actors, capital flows, and research projects.  
- **Knowledge Mobilization**: convenings, workshops, and open datasets to accelerate interdisciplinary learning.  
- **Finance Innovation**: working with systemic finance initiatives (e.g., FEST, TransCap) to design funding pathways that support long-term collaboration.  
- **AI-Enabled Insights**: using agentic AI to listen to and analyze patterns across maps, producing plain-language insights and potential “what-if” simulations for systemic interventions.  

# Anticipated Outcomes
- A living, international **map of climate–AI collaboration**, continuously updated and openly accessible.  
- Funding models that align capital flows with systemic climate needs, reducing duplication and surfacing underfunded opportunities.  
- Inclusion of **youth and Global South voices**, ensuring innovation agendas are equitable and globally relevant.  
- A trusted alliance framework to serve as a backbone for ongoing collaboration across conferences, institutions, and policy arenas.
